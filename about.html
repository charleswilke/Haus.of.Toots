                        <p><strong>Jessie's always been a chronic hobbyist</strong> in the best possible way. The kind of person who follows a spark until it becomes a skill.</p>
                        
                        <p>For years she orbited the world of threadcraft: cross-stitching, punch needling, experimenting with yarn weights and textures… Slowly filling the house with little pops of color. All of it, almost inevitably, led her to needlepoint.</p>
                        
                        <p>Needlepoint offered something the others didn't: calm. The rhythm. The structure. The way a painted canvas removes the guesswork and lets the hands settle into something meditative. It became her favorite kind of quiet.</p>
                        
                        <p>Originally from Anaheim, California, she's found home in Omaha, Nebraska where she's been welcomed into the needlepoint community, quickly forging new lifelong friendships.</p>

                        <p><strong>But Haus of Toots isn't built on hobby energy alone.</strong></p>
                        
                        <p>Jessie spent years managing teams, shaping customer experiences, and building trust with people from all walks of life. At <a href="https://www.farrow-ball.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Farrow & Ball</a>, she sharpened her color theory in practical application; watching how light, pigment, and environment shift the feeling of a room.</p>
                        
                        <p>At <a href="https://saltandstraw.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Salt & Straw</a>, she led with a gentle, servant-leadership style that centered on people, not pressure. Now, working in tech, as part of a customer experience team, she learned how to listen deeply, understand someone truly, and build those relationships into something meaningful.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>All of that perspective and experience folds into her needlepoint work.</strong></p>
                        
                        <p>When someone requests a custom needlepoint canvas, Jessie approaches it the way she always has: with curiosity, empathy, and an eye for the small details that make something feel special. Each canvas is designed with intention, crafted with care, and meant to be stitched into something cherished.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Haus of Toots is where craft and character meet.</strong> A place where hobbyist joy and professional care blend into something warm, thoughtful, and beautifully crafted.</p>
