## Deployment

### Setting up GitHub Actions for DreamHost

This site includes automatic deployment to DreamHost via SFTP using GitHub Actions.

#### Required Secrets

Add these secrets to your GitHub repository (Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions):

1. `SFTP_SERVER` - Your DreamHost SFTP server: `chawil155.dreamhosters.com`
2. `SFTP_USERNAME` - Your SFTP username: `jessieToots`
3. `SFTP_PASSWORD` - Your SFTP password (the one you set for the jessieToots user)

#### How it Works

1. Push changes to the `main` branch
2. GitHub Actions automatically triggers the deployment workflow
3. Files are uploaded to your DreamHost server via SFTP to `/home/jessieToots/hausoftoots.com/`
4. Your site is live at hausoftoots.com!

You can also manually trigger deployment from the Actions tab in GitHub.

### Manual Deployment

If you prefer to deploy manually:

1. Connect to your DreamHost server via SFTP:
   - Host: `chawil155.dreamhosters.com`
   - Username: `jessieToots`
   - Port: 21 (FTPS)
   - Remote directory: `/home/jessieToots/hausoftoots.com/`
2. Upload all files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`, and the `images` folder)
3. Your site is ready!

## Local Development

No build process required! Simply:

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Make changes and refresh to see updates

For a better development experience with live reload, you can use a simple local server:

```bash
# Using Python
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (with http-server)
npx http-server

# Using PHP
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

--coral-light: #FFB3BA;

--cream: #FAF8F5;
--linen: #F5F1EC;
```
